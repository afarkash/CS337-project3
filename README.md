Part of our AllFoods.json (descriptions, cooking methods) and tools.py files take entries from a former project to save time on typing: (https://github.com/tylrodg/CS337-Recipes). Our AllFoods.json also takes inspiration from another project for lists of spices, meats, and vegetables: (https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/tree/master/data/foods), also to save time on typing.

Pierce is an anagram of "recipe"

INSTRUCTIONS:
To begin chatting with our chatbot, Pierce, run:
>> python3 chatbot.py

Upon activation, Pierce will ask for a recipe URL from allrecipes.com

From there, you can ask for the ingredients or the directions, or you can apply transformations to the recipe.

Supported transformations include to and from healthy, to and from vegetarian, to Russian-inspired, to Italian-inspired, double quantity, and halve quantity.

Feel free to ask Pierce "what is" and "how to" questions at any point.

Once you see the directions, you can go through them step-by-step.

Type "exit" or "quit" to leave at any time.
